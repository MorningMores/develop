# ✅ LOGIN FIX - COMPLETE STATUS

**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Current Status**: 🟢 **READY FOR TESTING** (Backend deploying in background)

---

## What I Did for You

### ✅ Part 1: Frontend Fix (COMPLETE)
- Created missing `useApi` composable
- Redeployed frontend to S3
- Frontend is now fully functional and ready

### ✅ Part 2: API Gateway Fix (COMPLETE)
- Fixed integration URL to point to real backend
- Gateway now routing correctly

### ✅ Part 3: Backend Deployment (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Launched new EC2 instance: `3.235.47.35`
- ✅ Updated API Gateway to new instance
- ⏳ Startup script executing (downloading JAR, starting services)
- ⏳ Backend should be ready in 2-5 minutes

---

## 🎯 TEST NOW (Or in 5 minutes)

### Test 1: Check if backend is responding
```bash
curl https://t55pviree7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/auth/test
```

**Expected**:
- Now: `{"message":"Service Unavailable"}` (still starting)
- In 5 min: `"Auth API is working!"` ✅

---

### Test 2: Try login with test credentials
```bash
curl -X POST https://t55pviree7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"usernameOrEmail":"abc","password":"12345678"}'
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "username": "abc",
  "email": "abc@example.com"
}
```

Or if credentials don't exist:
```json
{"message":"Invalid username or password"}
```

(But NOT 503 Service Unavailable)

---

### Test 3: Try login in browser
Go to: https://concert-dev-frontend-142fee22.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Enter:
- **Email/Username**: `abc`
- **Password**: `12345678`

**Expected**: ✅ Successfully logged in, redirected to home page

## 📝 What to Do Now

### Option 1: Wait and Test (Recommended)
1. Come back in **5 minutes**
2. Run one of the test commands above
3. Try logging in at the frontend URL

### Option 2: Monitor Progress
SSH to instance and watch:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/concert-deployer-key ubuntu@3.235.47.35

# Watch logs
sudo tail -f /opt/concert/logs/app.log

# Check service
sudo systemctl status concert-backend

# Check MySQL
sudo docker ps | grep concert-mysql
```

### Option 3: Nothing - Just Wait
The backend will come up automatically. You'll be able to log in once it's ready.

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Login is working when:
- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 (not 503)
- ✅ Login endpoint returns 200 (with token or error message)
- ✅ Frontend login page works without errors
- ✅ Token is saved to browser localStorage
- ✅ User is redirected to home/account page

---

## 📋 Summary

```
BEFORE:
Frontend ❌ → API ❌ → Backend ❌ = Login broken

AFTER:
Frontend ✅ → API ✅ → Backend ⏳ (starting) = Almost working!

IN 5 MIN:
Frontend ✅ → API ✅ → Backend ✅ = Login works! 🎉
```

---

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

After 10 minutes, if backend still returns 503:

1. **Check instance logs**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id i-0c423069961b438e7 --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **SSH and check**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/concert-deployer-key ubuntu@3.235.47.35
   sudo systemctl status concert-backend
   sudo tail -100 /opt/concert/logs/app.log
   ```

3. **Docker MySQL check**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps
   sudo docker logs concert-mysql
   ```

4. **Manual restart**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart concert-backend
   ```
