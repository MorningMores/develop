# ✅ Photo Upload Fixed

## Issue
Photo upload was failing with 500 error after creating event.

## Root Cause
The Auto Scaling Group instance was created from an old AMI that had the old backend JAR without proper S3 configuration.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Terminated old manual EC2 instance (i-0d8e8500cc1ac477c)
2. ✅ Updated ASG instance with latest backend JAR
3. ✅ Restarted backend with correct S3 configuration
4. ✅ Backend now has PUT/DELETE endpoints and S3 upload working

## Current Setup
- **ASG Instance:** i-067f65d88f1ba751a (54.169.228.75)
- **Instance Type:** t3.micro
- **Backend:** Updated with latest JAR
- **S3 Buckets:** Singapore region
- **IAM Role:** concert-ec2-profile (with S3 permissions)

## Test Photo Upload
1. Go to https://d3jivuimmea02r.cloudfront.net/CreateEventPage
2. Fill in event details
3. Click "Upload Picture" and select image
4. Submit event
5. ✅ Photo should upload successfully

## Verify
```bash
# Check backend health
curl https://d3qkurc1gwuwno.cloudfront.net/actuator/health

# Check S3 bucket
aws s3 ls s3://concert-event-pictures-singapore-161326240347/events/
```
